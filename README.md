### This microservice is created for conducting polls using a blockchain Steem. A platform is a thin client, that works without backend (only frontend and blockchain) directly on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) through [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
### Built With
* [Steem.js](https://github.com/steemit/steem-js) - the JavaScript API for Steem blockchain;
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) - the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web;
* [SweetAlert2](https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2) - a beautiful, responsive, customizable, accessible replacement for JavaScript's popup boxes;
* [I18next](https://www.i18next.com) -  is an internationalization-framework written in and for JavaScript;
* [Flag-icon-css](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icon-css) -  A collection of all country flags in SVG;
* [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment/) - A lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates;
* [IcoMoon-Free](https://github.com/Keyamoon/IcoMoon-Free) - IcoMoon-Free is a free vector icon pack;
* [findAndReplaceDOMText](https://github.com/padolsey/findAndReplaceDOMText) - searches for regular expression matches in a given DOM node and replaces or wraps each match with a node or piece of text that you can specify.
* [Highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js)  -  is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any markup, doesnâ€™t depend on any framework, and has automatic language detection.

### Getting Started
